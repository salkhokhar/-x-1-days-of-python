### About The Repository
I am creating this repo as a guide to introducing python in bite size chunks and updating it regularly.


### Instructions for Installing Python
Hey hey hey!!!
Hold onto your horses. Read this through before diving in the deep end.
You do not always need to install python on your machine. There are cases where you would benefit from cloud based python environments. I, personally have been using [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for some time. It has been a great experience. All you need is a google account and you are good to go. It can be accessed remotely and it also provides services for a GPU for free. So, if you are just starting out, I would recommend using Colab at first.

If you wold still like to install pyhton on your machine, you still have a lot of options to choose from. 
1. Installing via [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). It will install python and a lot more like Jupyter Notebooks (the environment on which colab is based on), conda package manager etc.
2. Installing [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then choosing your code editor.
